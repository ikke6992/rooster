# Rooster
Rooster is a planning application for ITVitae, which allows its students and teachers (Users) to view their lesson schedule, and the scheduler (Admin) to create and update that schedule.

## User view
Upon opening the page, the user gets presented with the lesson schedule for the current month. This schedule shows on which date and in which classroom a group has lessons planned.

The user can switch to the next or previous month, has an option to print the schedule and an option to download the schedule as an excel-file. The user can also switch to the free days view to see which free days the user gets at ITVitae. The user has the option to log in as admin.

## Admin view
The admin has access to everything the user has and more. On the View Schedule page, the admin is able to drag lessons to different days and/or different classrooms to change a lesson. In the future, the admin will also be able to add or delete lessons from this view. In the Free Days view, the admin can also add or remove free days.

Then there are different views the admin has access to. The Groups view offers the possibility to view, add, edit or archive groups. The Teachers view can do the same for teachers. The Archive view shows the groups that have been archived and are no longer visible on the schedule.
